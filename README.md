Multiplexed Control of Six 7-Segment Common Cathode Displays Designed in Altium

This project demonstrates the multiplexed control of six 7-segment common cathode displays (reference: ACSC02-41SURKWA-F01) using NPN transistors (reference: MMBT3904TT1G), with one transistor per display. Each segment is connected through 1K ohm resistors.

The outputs for the seven segments and the six common cathodes are routed to a header for easy interfacing.

The repository includes all necessary datasheets, as well as the schematic and PCB design files developed in Altium.
